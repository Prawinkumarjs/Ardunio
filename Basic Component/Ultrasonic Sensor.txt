Ultrasonic Sensor

How It Works â€“ Ultrasonic Sensor



  It emits ultrasound at 40 000 Hz which travels through the air and if there is an object or obstacle on its path It will bounce back to the module. Considering the travel time and the speed of the sound you can calculate the distance 



Why 58 / 57.8 ?

the speed of sound is 340 meters/second 
Its is 29 centimeter/microseconds value is the duration of the round trip 
we need half of it 

value/29/2 = value / 58
