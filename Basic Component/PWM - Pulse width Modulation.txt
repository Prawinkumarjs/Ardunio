PWM - Pulse width Modulation

PWM analogWrite()

digitalWrite(pin Number, HIGH)  -> 5 volts
digitalWrite(pin Number,  LOW)  -> 0 volts


Arduino can provide any analog value

0% Duty Cycle - analogWrite(0)
25% Duty Cycle - analogWrite(64)
50% Duty Cycle - analogWrite(127)
75% Duty Cycle - analogWrite(191)
100% Duty Cycle - analogWrite(255)
